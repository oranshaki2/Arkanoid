# Arkanoid Game- Java OOP Project
This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Arkanoid game, developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course 

during the second semester of my second year at Bar-Ilan University.

## 🎮 About
The game was built over a 6-part progressive assignment and is uniquely implemented using a single-threaded architecture—

an uncommon approach in game development.  

Moreover, no built-in Java GUI components were used; instead, a custom GUI framework was utilized to create an interactive, 

user-friendly game interface.

The game demonstrates a solid understanding of core OOP concepts and software design principles, including:

- Polymorphism and Inheritance

- Implementation of Design Patterns such as Observer and Builder

- Use of Generic Data Structures like LinkedList and ArrayList

- Custom GUI development in Java

Developed using Java in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, this project highlights my ability to design, structure, 

and implement object-oriented software from scratch in a game development context.

## How to Run the Game
### 🔧 Running via Java IDE
Clone or download the entire source code from this repository.

Open the project using your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Make sure to include the biuoop-1.4.jar file in your project's classpath.

Navigate to the ass6/src/ directory and run the Ass6Game.java file.

### 🕹️ Gameplay Instructions

- Move the Paddle: Use the Left Arrow (←) to move left and the Right Arrow (→) to move right.
