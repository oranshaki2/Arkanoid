# Arkanoid Game- Java OOP Project
This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Arkanoid game, developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course during the second semester of my second year at Bar-Ilan University.

## About
The game was built over a 6-part progressive assignment and is uniquely implemented using a single-threaded architectureâ€”an uncommon approach in game development. 
Moreover, no built-in Java GUI components were used; instead, a custom GUI framework (included in this repository) was utilized to create an interactive, user-friendly game interface.

The game demonstrates a solid understanding of core OOP concepts and software design principles, including:

- Polymorphism and Inheritance

- Implementation of Design Patterns such as Observer and Builder

- Use of Generic Data Structures like LinkedList and ArrayList

- Custom GUI development in Java

Developed using Java in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, this project highlights my ability to design, structure, and implement object-oriented software from scratch in a game development context.
